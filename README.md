# nhanes_inferential_2021_23
This project analyzes data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2021–2023) to explore relationships between demographic, behavioral, and health variables. The objective is to apply inferential statistical techniques to uncover meaningful associations among factors such as marital status, education, sedentary behavior, blood pressure, and kidney health.

All analyses were conducted in Google Colab using both Python and R, following the statistical workflows and documentation style demonstrated in class notebooks. Each question includes data cleaning, recoding, statistical testing (Chi-square, t-test, regression, and correlation), and relevant visualizations to support interpretation.

## Question 1: "Is there an association between marital status (married or not married) and education level (bachelor’s degree or higher vs. less than a bachelor’s degree)?"
